British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep. \nGermany 'srepresentative to the European Union 'sveterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer. \n\"We do n'tsupport any such recommendation because we do n'tsee any grounds for it, \"the Commission 'schief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing. \nHe said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union. \nHe said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health. \nFischler proposed EU-widemeasures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE )--mad cow disease. \nBut Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU 'sstanding veterinary committee, mational animal health officials, questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health. \nSpanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers 'meeting of causing unjustified alarm through \"dangerous generalisation. \"\n. \nOnly France and Britain backed Fischler 'sproposal. \nThe EU 'sscientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to re-examinethe issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials. \nSheep have long been known to contract scrapie, a brain-wastingdisease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste. \nBritish farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep, but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe. \n\"What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany 'slead, \"Welsh National Farmers 'Union (NFU )chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio. \nBonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef. \nGermany imported 47,600sheep from Britain last year, nearly half of total imports. \nIt brought in 4,275tonnes of British mutton, some 10 percent of overall imports. \n", "\nRare Hendrix song draft sells for almost $17,000. \nLONDON 1996-08-22\nA rare early handwritten draft of a song by U.S.guitar legend Jimi Hendrix was sold for almost $17,000on Thursday at an auction of some of the late musician 'sfavourite possessions. \nA Florida restaurant paid 10,925pounds ($16,935)for the draft of \"Ai n'tno telling \", which Hendrix penned on a piece of London hotel stationery in late 1966. \nAt the end of a January 1967 concert in the English city of Nottingham he threw the sheet of paper into the audience, where it was retrieved by a fan. \nBuyers also snapped up 16 other items that were put up for auction by Hendrix 'sformer girlfriend Kathy Etchingham, who lived with him from 1966 to 1969. \nThey included a black lacquer and mother of pearl inlaid box used by Hendrix to store his drugs, which an anonymous Australian purchaser bought for 5,060pounds ($7,845). \nThe guitarist died of a drugs overdose in 1970 aged 27. \n", "\nChina says Taiwan spoils atmosphere for talks. \nBEIJING 1996-08-22\nChina on Thursday accused Taipei of spoiling the atmosphere for a resumption of talks across the Taiwan Strait with a visit to Ukraine by Taiwanese Vice President Lien Chan this week that infuriated Beijing. \nSpeaking only hours after Chinese state media said the time was right to engage in political talks with Taiwan, Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang told Reuters :\"The necessary atmosphere for the opening of the talks has been disrupted by the Taiwan authorities. \"\nState media quoted China 'stop negotiator with Taipei, Tang Shubei, as telling a visiting group from Taiwan on Wednesday that it was time for the rivals to hold political talks. \n\"Now is the time for the two sides to

in an interview he had read reports of Tang 'scomments but gave no details of why the negotiator had considered the time right for talks with Taiwan, which Beijing considers a renegade province.

Siegel\nJERUSALEM 1996-08-22\nIsrael 'soutgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup. \nItamar Rabinovich, who as Israel 'sambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria, told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight. \n\"It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate. \nThe Syrians are confused, they are definitely tense, but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup, \"he said. \nRabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador. \nHe will be replaced by Eliahu Ben-Elissar, a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and right-wingLikud party politician. \nIsrael on Wednesday sent Syria a message, via Washington, saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions. \nBut it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere. \nSyria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile. \nIt said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes. \n\"The message that we sent to (Syrian President Hafez al-)Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations, \"Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview. \nTension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war. \nIsraeli-Syrianpeace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since 1991 despite the previous government 'swillingness to make Golan concessions. \nPeace talks between the two sides were last held in February. \n\"The voices coming out of Damascus are bad, not good. \nThe media ...\nare full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying ...\nthis artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners, \"Levy said. \n\"We expect from Syria, if its face is to peace, that it will answer Israel 'smessage to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal, \"he said. \"\nWe do not want a war, God forbid. \nNo one benefits from wars. \"\nIsrael 'sChannel Two television said Damascus had sent a \"calming signal \"to Israel. \nIt gave no source for the report. \nNetanyahu and Levy 'sspokesmen said they could not confirm it. \nThe television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo, the United

sheepmeat from other countries, \"ministry official Werner Zwingmann told ZDF television. \n\"I do not want to say that there is a concrete danger for consumers, \"he added. \"\nThere are too many holes in what we know, and these must be filled very quickly. \"\nBonn has led efforts to ensure consumer protection tops the list of priorities in dealing with the mad cow crisis, which erupted in March when Britain acknowledged humans could contract a similar illness by eating contaminated beef. \nThe European Commission agreed this month to rethink a proposal to ban the use of suspect sheep tissue after some EU veterinary experts questioned whether it was justified. \nEU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler had proposed banning sheep brains, spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE )--mad cow disease. \nBut some members of the EU 'sstanding veterinary committee questioned whether the action was necessary given the slight risk to human health. \nThe question is being studied separately by two EU scientific committees. \nSheep have long been known to contract scrapie, a similar brain-wastingdisease to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste. \nBritish officials say sheep meat is perfectly safe to eat. \nZDF said Germany imported 47,600sheep from Britain last year, nearly half of total imports. \nIt brought in 4,275tonnes of British mutton, some 10 percent of overall imports. \nAfter the British government admitted a possible link between mad cow disease and its fatal human equivalent, the EU imposed a worldwide ban on British beef exports. \nEU leaders agreed at a summit in June to a progressive lifting of the ban as Britain takes parallel measures to eradicate the disease. \n", "\nGOLF -SCORES AT WORLD SERIES OF GOLF. \nAKRON, Ohio 1996-08-22\nScores from

Basuki of Indonesia. \nWednesday 'sU.S.Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round. \nLooming in Sampras 'sfuture is a likely third-rounddate with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis, the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January. \nSampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19-year-oldpower hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some first-weekfireworks. \nWhile only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28th-rankedveteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus. \nThere will be no repeat of last year 'smen 'sfinal with eighth-rankedAndre Agassi landing in Sampras 'shalf of the draw. \nBumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided
